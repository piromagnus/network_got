    "# Comparison between Neo4j and Networkx\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to compare some algorithms implemented in both Neo4j Graph Data Science and Python's package Networkx.\n",
    "I used the database from https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf corresponding to interactions between the characters of the books of the saga Song of Ice and Fire by G.R.R Martin.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran all the tests on my PC with the following configuration :\n",
    "- Intel Core  i5-9300H 2,40 GHz, 4 core, 8 Mo cache memory (turbo 4,10 GHz)\n",
    "- 12 GB RAM \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of data\n",
    "The dataset was made according to the books. Two characters are interacting if they are in a 15-words range in a book. The more they are interacting the more the interactions weight is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we consider the 5 first books. There is 2823 relations on 796 nodes which are the characters in the saga.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some stats about the interactions of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "|min|max|avg interactions|stdev|\n",
    "|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n",
    "|1|110|4.620294599017998|8.651722878451903|\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I compare\n",
    "Due to the implementation of Neo4j's graphs, I had considered 2 different mesures of time. One is the first iteration of the algorithm and the other is the average time of the following iterations where the Neo4j's cache memory reduces the computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare networkx and Neo4j, I chose to compare the different implemantion of Betweenness centrality, Page Rank, Label Propagation, BFS and MST.\n",
    "They are different type of algorithms which are implemented both in Neo4j and Networkx. Much of the algorithms are implemented in only one of them.\n",
    "I will compare the average time to compute these algorithms with the same graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithms \n",
    "#### Page Rank\n",
    "This algorithm aims to compute the impact of a node on the graph. I assume Neo4j and Networkx used the same implemented of this algorithms like in this [paper](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html).\n",
    "I configure damping= 0.85 and max iterations=20 in both softwares.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "This algorithm returns the node which is in the most path between nodes. I don't really know if the implementations are the same.\n",
    "I used the default parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Label Propagation\n",
    "This algorithm is a community clustering algorithm which creates community of nodes whose have similary labels.\n",
    "I think the implementations are the same because the algorithm is clear as we can see [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/label-propagation/).\n",
    "I also used default parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BFS\n",
    "This algorithm is a classic in graph analysis. I assume both implementations are equivalent. \n",
    "I limit the depth at 5 nodes and start at the node `Jon Snow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MST\n",
    "It is also a classic algorithm. \n",
    "Neo4j used Prim's algorithm and Networkx used Kruskal's one. The complexity is similar between the two algorithms.\n",
    "I used default parameters.\n",
    "\n"

But is some case (Betweenness and Page rank) Neo4j is better or  getting even better after the first iteration due to the use of a cache. We also can see that weighted or unweighted Page rank doesn't change anything for neo4j but changes a bit for networkx. (This precisition is lower for neo4j)\n",
